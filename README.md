## Project-Code---Python
AI agent to solve the Raven's test. The Ravens test includes 2X2 and 3X3  problems. Current implementation uses the python image lirary Pillow for manipulating images. Image difference algorithm is employed in the calculation.  Efficiency and accuracy can be improved by applying logical manipulations like XOR, AND and OR operations on the images.   

## Usage
run with python 2.7.
results of the run can be seen in the answers csv file
